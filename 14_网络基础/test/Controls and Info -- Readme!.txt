[Mouse] or [Arrow Keys] + [Enter] to walk & navigate

This mini-episode is about 20 minutes long, and there is no save feature -- so be ready to play through it all in one go! 

Also, there is no menu. Or proper quitting function... you have to Alt-F4 if you want to quit before the end of the game. It's kind of a trap, really.

...Cheers!
